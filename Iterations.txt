These iterations build upon your existing foundation and introduce more complexity in manageable steps. They set the stage for the more advanced features you envision for the future, such as hedge funds, dark pools, and complex economic simulations, without overwhelming the current state of the project.
Key aspects of this plan:

It introduces more realistic market dynamics gradually.
It improves the AI trader simulation, making the market more dynamic.
It begins to incorporate economic factors, setting the stage for more complex economic modeling.
It adds more sophisticated trading tools that real traders use.
It provides basic analysis and reporting tools, enhancing the user experience and the educational aspect of the simulation.

This plan should give you a clear path forward while keeping in mind your long-term vision for Deeponomics. As you complete these iterations, you'll be in a better position to implement the more complex features in your long-term plan.
